<!-- Plugin description -->
Welcome to the **IntelliJ JSON Explorer Plugin**, a powerful tool for developers working with JSON files directly within
their favorite IDE. This plugin provides a rich, intuitive experience for visualizing, comparing, and editing JSON data,
ensuring maximum productivity with minimal effort.

## üåü Features

### 1. Multiple JSON Views

Explore your JSON data in the view that suits your needs:

- **JSON View**: A raw, yet structured view for direct manipulation.
- **Table View**: View JSON data in a tabular format, allowing easy navigation through key-value pairs.
- **Tree View**: A hierarchical view of your JSON, perfect for exploring deeply nested structures.

### 2. JSON Comparison

Easily compare two JSON files side-by-side to see:

- **Nodes Added**: Identifies new elements introduced in the updated JSON.
- **Nodes Removed**: Tracks items that have been deleted.
- **Nodes Modified**: Highlights changes in values for existing keys.

This feature is especially useful for version control, code reviews, or verifying the integrity of your data.

### 3. Interactive Table Editing

- **Double-click Editing**: In the **Table View**, you can double-click on any cell to open a detailed view of the JSON
  element in a subpanel. From there, you can choose different view modes to further inspect or edit the JSON.
- **Nested JSON Support**: Seamlessly explore and edit deeply nested JSON elements within the table view.

### 4. Offline Functionality

Designed with **corporate users** in mind, the plugin works entirely **offline**. This means:

- **No Internet Connection Required**: All JSON operations (viewing, comparing, editing) happen locally on your machine.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Since no data is sent over the internet, it is ideal for environments where data
  privacy is paramount.

## üõ°Ô∏è Corporate Use Case

This plugin was built with **corporate environments** in mind, where **data privacy** is crucial. Since it operates
entirely offline:

- You don‚Äôt need to worry about sensitive data being uploaded or shared with online services.
- All processing happens locally, making it a safe choice for companies with strict data protection policies.
